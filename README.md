# php-shareposts-app

PHP posts sharing application built on a custom MVC framework with a MySQL Database, created during studying OOP PHP & MVC course by Brad Traversy.

To gain foundational knowledge of PHP using the MVC pattern before diving into PHP frameworks like Laravel or Symfony.

## Features

- Access control for posts.
- Full user authentication.
- Server side form validation.
